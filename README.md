# 💬 Offline Chat-Reply Recommendation System using Transformers

This project builds an *offline chat-reply recommendation system* that predicts the next possible reply from *User A* when *User B* sends a message — using past two-person chat data as context.  
It fine-tunes a *Transformer-based model (GPT-2)* to generate coherent, context-aware replies, evaluated using BLEU and ROUGE metrics.
